## Hacktoberfest 2020 :jack_o_lantern:

This repo is participating in [hacktoberfest 2020](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), so **please** be sure to read the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

This library is **very much a work in progress**, so there are missing features, lacks of tests, missing documentation (like the rest of this repo), and non-intentional design flaws. This library has the main goal of providing a framework to **contribute and learn**, while still building something that should be useful to someone somewhere at sometime. Along with the goal of providing a framework and environment to contribute to open source, this library should allow everyone to get their fair share of hacktoberfest PR's, so use your best judgement so everyone can contribute!

Thank you, keep learing, keep building and happy hacktoberfest! :+1:
